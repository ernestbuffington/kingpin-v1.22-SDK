vertex lights become dark after map transition (vid_restart fixes)
	- FIXED, caused by allocating 0x800000 max size for md2 models
	
crash on darksun1.bsp when vertexlight/vertexlightbase fields not properly allocated (Hunk_Alloc problem?)
	- FIXED, caused by allocating same size for each poly in a surface

crashes when loading a game that has a target_text box open
	- FIXED by clearing textdisplay pointer in each client struct during load process

skin name the same as player model name duplicated in skin display list
	- FIXED with better filename checking
	
2D disappearing when in 3rd person mode w/ projection shadows
	- FIXED by clearing z coordinate in vertex array	
	
drops to console (SV_DemoCompleted, SV_Nextserver called twice) when changing from demo to normal map in a nextserver sequence (Belly of the Beast, SOG)
	- FIXED by clearing sv.demofile file handle in SV_DemoCompleted

models with bad skinnums rendered as invisible (0 alpha?)
	- FIXED by checking skinnum before assgning renderparms

invalid player models causing crashes?
	- likely caused by corrupt data

alpha test textures not displaying properly on ATI cards (lightmap blended into alpha channel?)

no audio in Q2 intermission cinematics
