Added -t option to export data type

Changed command line syntax to:

Extractfuncs <file1> [<file2> ..] [-t <structname>] [-o <func_list> <func_decs>] [-d <define>]

Added skipping the parsing of macros with parameters (not relevant to extraction)

Imported from the Wolf MP version, Mac/Linux friendly version
Fixed argbase bug in *nix main
Escape BoxOnPlaneSide on linux (taken out by preprocessing)

Modified extractfuncs to works on linux
Would still need to integrate it correctly with the build system
Changed the command line syntax of the linux ver:
screwup [-o <basename>] <file1> [<file2> ..]

if none specified, <basename> is "g_funcs"

on linux at least, those header files need to be tweaked by hand
because unresolved externs are not ignored by gcc (otherwise harmless on win32)
